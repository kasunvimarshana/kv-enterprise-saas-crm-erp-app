Act as a Full-Stack Engineer and Principal Systems Architect; Review and observe all information from the provided reference links, analyze their concepts, patterns, and best practices, and update all project documentation to accurately reflect and align with the extracted knowledge and insights. Thoroughly audit and review all existing documentation, repositories, source code, schemas, configurations, and workflows to build a complete conceptual model of a multi-tenant, enterprise-grade ERP/CRM SaaS platform. Analyze the referenced resources to extract and understand concepts, architecture, domains, modules, entities, relationships, and workflows, focusing on observation and learning before implementation. Rely strictly on native Laravel and Vue features. Always implement functionality manually instead of using third-party libraries. Use stable, well-supported LTS libraries only when absolutely necessary, and avoid experimental, deprecated, or abandoned dependencies. Identify all system domains and modules, detect any missing or incomplete modules, and implement them according to documented domain boundaries, workflows, and relationships. Apply Clean Architecture, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), SOLID, and API-first principles. Ensure strict tenant and organizational isolation, RBAC/ABAC via native Laravel policies and middleware, event-driven workflows using native events and queues, and clear module documentation. All code must be clean, readable, maintainable, and production-ready, follow industry best practices, use meaningful and consistent naming, adhere to established coding standards, and be designed for scalability, security, maintainability, and long-term sustainability. No placeholders, partial implementations, or unnecessary external dependencies are permitted. Review all existing documentation and the workspace, identify all modules, and implement them accordingly. Review all existing documentation and the workspace. Analyze the resources below to extract concepts, architecture, modules, entities, and relationships, focusing solely on observation and learning to build a comprehensive conceptual model. Rely strictly on native Laravel and Vue features. Avoid experimental, deprecated, or abandoned dependencies, and rely on native Laravel features instead of external packages:

Act as Full-Stack Engineer \& Principal Architect: audit all repos, docs, code, schemas, configs, integrations, workflows \& rules to model multi-tenant enterprise ERP/CRM SaaS. Extract architecture, domains, modules, entities, relationships \& workflows. Design the application to be fully dynamic, configurable, extensible, and reusable. Ensure all behavior, rules, pricing, and modules are metadata-driven, plugin-style, loosely coupled, and customizable without code changes, using only native Laravel and Vue features. Implement all modules with native Laravel \& Vue, enforcing Clean Architecture, DDD, SOLID, API-first, strict tenant/org isolation, RBAC/ABAC via policies/middleware, event-driven workflows, hierarchical orgs, JWT stateless auth, concurrency, audit logging \& enterprise security. Build fully loosely coupled plugin-style modules with dynamic install/remove, extensible pricing engines, rule-driven calculations (flat/%, tiered), product/service/combo models with configurable buying/selling units \& location-based pricing. Use enums \& env vars, clear domain boundaries; produce clean, readable, documented, secure, scalable, maintainable, production-ready code; no placeholders, partials, or unsupported dependencies.
